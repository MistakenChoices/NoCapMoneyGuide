Note: Before trusting any guide at all, (Including this one) you should check trusted sources and etc. (Such as reddit, which should be fairly reliable) [r/beermoney](reddit.com/r/beermoney)


üó∫ Websites
- [Swagbucks](https://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=66879362)
‚ö† Very low/Hard to get money (even in 1 day.)

- [Earnably](https://earnably.com/join/2117835)
‚úî Pretty easy and results in maybe 1 dollar per day if you really put effort in.




üì± Android Apps to AVOID
- Lucky Chest

Complete waste of time! (Don't use at all.)

- ZBD/ZEBEDEE

Pretty decent, but you can't get money right to paypal. Only to supported giftcards etc (country dependent. Meaning, if the giftcard is for USA, you can't redeem it anywhere else.)

- StormGain

Unknown, (I don't have much experience yet, but it takes some time and I've heard a lot of bad reviews.)

- Any Apps from this guy: https://www.youtube.com/@moneyonlineisreal 

(Complete waste of time. Check the newest comments, and you will see how bad it really is. Avoid at all costs.)
